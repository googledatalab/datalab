    "Notebooks authored in Datalab are automatically saved in the git repository associated with the  Cloud project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The git repository associated with a Cloud project is provided by the [Source Repository](https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-repositories/docs/) service. A source repository is a git repository, and can optionally be configured to connect and synchronize with an external git repository, such as one on GitHub. In addition to providing git functionality, a source repository also provides the concept of a workspace (built using git) per user, which enables performing edits, and manage them as pending or uncommitted changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Datalab is deployed into a Cloud project the following additions are made to the source repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A branch named \"datalab\", if it is the first instance of Datalab in the Cloud project. This is setup as an orphaned branch, so it doesn't contain any of the content of other branches in your repository, should they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A branch per Datalab workspace that is a child off of the \"datalab\" branch. This is named as \"datalab_name-of-workspace\". For example, for the default \"main\" Datalab workspace, this will be named \"datalab_main\". The branch inherits all contents from \"datalab\" branch. All edits within a Datalab instance are automatically saved as uncommitted changes of the current user within this branch (user’s workspace). This branch can be reviewed for pending changes and committing changes upstream to the parent \"datalab\" branch within the Developer Console. Specifically, within the Source Code > Browse section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships between Datalab instances and the branches in its git repository are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cloud Project1         ----------      \"datalab\" branch (in Project1)\n",
    "\n",
    "      Datalab instance1    ----------      \"datalab_instance1\" branch, child off of \"datalab\" branch\n",
    "        user1's edits      ----------       user1's workspace in \"datalab_instance1\" branch\n",
    "        user2's edits      ----------       user2's workspace in \"datalab_instance1\" branch\n",
